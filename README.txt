The GMAT build system is configured using CMAKE.  Please see the instructions at

   https://gmat.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GW/pages/380273355/Compiling+GMAT+CMake+Build+System

for additional information.

Note that users building GMAT from source will need the GMAT data files package,

   GMAT-datafiles-R2022a.zip

from SourceForge in order to run GMAT.  The data folder in that package should 
be placed, with all subfolders, into the GMAT application folder.
